Lionel Messi: A Hyper-Interactive Scroll-Tale

This is a passion project I built to tell the story of Lionel Messi's incredible career. I wanted to go beyond a static webpage and create something more engaging and memorable. The result is a single-page site that uses a variety of scroll-based animations to bring his journey to life.


# What I Built

I focused on creating a fluid, cinematic experience. As you scroll through the page, you'll see:

* **Dynamic Animations:** I used `IntersectionObserver` to make sure animations trigger smoothly and efficiently right when they come into view.
* **Engaging Parallax Effects:** The page reacts to your scroll position and even your mouse movement, adding a sense of depth and interactivity.
* **A Unique Horizontal Gallery:** I wrote a custom script that transforms the normal vertical scroll into a horizontal one for the photo gallery section. It was a fun challenge!
* **Smooth Performance:** To keep everything running without any stutter, all the animations are powered by `requestAnimationFrame`, which is the browser-friendly way to handle this kind of thing.
* **A Fully Responsive Layout:** I designed it from the ground up to look and feel great, whether you're on a phone, a tablet, or a desktop computer.
