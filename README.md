### Project Overview

This project was developed to demonstrate a command of modern, performant front-end technologies without relying on external libraries or frameworks. The goal was to create a dynamic, visually-driven user experience centered around scroll-based event handling and advanced CSS.

### Technical Breakdown

* **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** I used the `IntersectionObserver` API to efficiently trigger animations only when elements enter the viewport, optimizing performance.
* **Parallax & Mouse Tracking:** The site implements both scroll-based parallax and mouse-tracking listeners to create a sense of depth and interactivity.
* **Horizontal Scroll Section:** I wrote a custom JavaScript solution that hijacks vertical scroll events within a specific container to drive horizontal content movement.
* **Performant Rendering:** All animations are tied to the browser's rendering cycle using `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure a smooth, jank-free experience.
* **Responsive Architecture:** Built with a mobile-first approach using modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid for a consistent layout across all screen sizes.
